# HTTP Problem Details (RFC 7807) for Node.js

This library implements HTTP Problem details (RFC 7807) for HTTP APIs.

## Installation

```
npm install http-problem-details
```

or

```
yarn add http-problem-details
```

## Usage

`http-problem-details` current supports these options:

* `type` (string) - A URI reference [[RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986)] that identifies the problem type.
* `title` (string) - A short, human-readable summary of the problem type.
* `status` (number) - The HTTP status code ([[RFC7231], SectionÂ 6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6)) generated by the origin server for this occurrence of the problem. If only `status` is provided `type` will be set to `about:blank` and `title` will be become the reason phrase as of the HTTP spec, e.g. "Not Found" if `status` is `404`.
* `instance` (stringt) - A URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of the problem.
* Extension Members - Provide additional information.

`type` and `instance` are validated to be valid URIs and will throw errors if not.

### Example

To generate this `problem+json` result

```json
{
    "type": "https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit",
    "title": "You do not have enough credit.",
    "detail": "Your current balance is 30, but that costs 50.",
    "instance": "/account/12345/msgs/abc",
    "status": 400
}
```

this code is required:

```javascript
const ProblemDocument = require('http-problem-details').ProblemDocument;

const doc = new ProblemDocument({
  type: 'https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit',
  title: 'You do not have enough credit.',
  detail: 'Your current balance is 30, but that costs 50.',
  instance: '/account/12345/msgs/abc',
  status: 400
});
```

### Example with Extension Members

To generate this `problem+json` result

```json
{
    "type": "https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit",
    "title": "You do not have enough credit.",
    "balance": 30,
    "accounts": ["/account/12345", "/account/67890"]
}
```

this code is required:

```javascript
const ProblemDocument = require('http-problem-details').ProblemDocument;
const ProblemDocumentExtension = require('http-problem-details').ProblemDocumentExtension;

const extension = new ProblemDocumentExtension({
  balance: 30,
  accounts: ['/account/12345', '/account/67890']
});

const doc = new ProblemDocument({
  type: 'https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit',
  title: 'You do not have enough credit.'
}, extension);
```
